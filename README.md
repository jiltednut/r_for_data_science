While working through "Mastering Shiny", I realised that I could use some elements of the tidyverse but could use an upgrade in terms of my flexibility and ability to apply analytical principles.
Luckily Hadley has published a lot of content to help level up.
This book is full of examples and I will continue to add my solutions along with those that are suggested in the solution guide.
So far, I've been missing some of the subtlety of the tools available and how to best use them in performing and analysis, which is why I am working through the book, so happy days!
